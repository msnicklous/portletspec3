/**
 * <div class='changed_added_3_0'>
 * Designates a conditional dispatcher method.
 * The portlet container will invoke the annotated method when it determines 
 * that <code>@RenderMethod</code>, <code>@HeaderMethod</code>, or 
 * <code>@ServeResourceMethod</code> annotated methods
 * are available for dispatching during request processing.
 * <p>
 * The annotated method must have one of the following signatures:
 * <p>
 *    <code>public boolean &lt;methodName&gt;(RenderRequest request, RenderResponse response, 
 *                Set<MethodToken> methods)</code>
 * <p>   
 *    <code>public boolean &lt;methodName&gt;(HeaderRequest request, HeaderResponse response, 
 *                Set<MethodToken> methods)</code>
 * <p>   
 *    <code>public boolean &lt;methodName&gt;(ResourceRequest request, ResourceResponse response, 
 *                Set<MethodToken> methods)</code>
 * <p>   
 * where the method name can be freely selected.
 * <p>
 * For a given portlet name, only a single method of each type may be annotated. 
 * If a conditional dispatcher is declared in the portlet deployment descriptor, that
 * declaration overrides any <code>@ConditionalDispatchMethod</code> annotation.
 * <p>
 * The method should analyze the given <code>Set</code> of candidate methods using
 * the annotations available from each <code>MethodToken</code> 
 * based on the current request and
 * create a list of method tokens representing the methods to be invoked. 
 * The output list may be empty or <code>null</code>. 
 * A given method token may appear in the output list more than once.  
 * <p>
 * If the method returns a non-<code>null</code> List object, the portlet container will
 * invoke the methods in the order they appear in the list, and then 
 * perform no further dispatching operation for the current request.
 * <p>
 * If the method returns <code>null</code>, the portlet container will dispatch the 
 * method using its implementation-specific algorithm.
 * <p>
 * If the method throws an exception, it will be treated as an unhandled exception
 * during request processing. The portlet container will perform no 
 * further dispatching.
 * <p>
 * The method declaration may contain a throws clause. Exceptions declared in the 
 * throws clause should be of type {@link javax.portlet.PortletException} or
 * {@link java.io.IOException}. 
 * If the <code>throws</code> clause defines exceptions of any other type, 
 * it will be treated as a configuration error.
