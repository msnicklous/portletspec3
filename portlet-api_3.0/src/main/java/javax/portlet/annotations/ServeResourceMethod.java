/**

 * Designates a method corresponding to the portlet API serveResource method.
 * <p>
 * The annotated method must have one of the following signatures:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <code>public void &lt;methodName&gt;(ResourceRequest, ResourceResponse)</code>
 * <p>
 * This corresponds to the <code>serveResource</code> method.
 * </li>   
 * <li>
 * <code>public String &lt;methodName&gt;()</code>
 * <p>
 * The String returned by the method will be written to the response unchanged. 
 * </li>   
 * <li>
 * <code>public void &lt;methodName&gt;()</code>
 * <p>
 * Intended for use when only a resource include is needed. 
 * </li>   
 * </ul> 
 * where the method name can be freely selected.
 * <p>
 * The method declaration may contain a throws clause. Exceptions declared in the 
 * throws clause should be of type {@link javax.portlet.PortletException} or
 * {@link java.io.IOException}. 
 * Checked exceptions of any other type will be caught, wrapped with a PortletException, 
 * and rethrown.
