 * <P>
 * A portlet mode indicates the function a portlet is performing.
 * Normally, portlets perform different tasks and create different
 * content depending on the function they are currently performing.
 * When invoking a portlet, the portlet container provides the
 * current portlet mode to the portlet.
 * <p>
 * Portlets can programmatically change their portlet
 * mode when processing an action request.
 * <P>
 * This class defines the default portlet modes <code>EDIT, HELP, VIEW</code>.
 * Additional portlet modes may be defined by calling the constructor
 * of this class. If a portal/portlet-container does not support a 
 * custom portlet mode defined in the portlet application deployment descriptor, 
 * the custom portlet mode will be ignored by the portal/portlet container.
