            <div class="description">The "portlet" namespace is reserved for use by portalJavaScript support implementations.<p>Portlet Specification 2.0 (JSR 286) provided Ajax support for portlets byadding a resource URL, resource request, and serveResource() method to allowportlet JavaScript code to retrieve data directly from the portlet.Portlet Specification 3.0 (JSR 362) expands on that by providing capabilityallowing a portlet to change its state through JavaScript functions.<p>Portlet Specification 3.0 introduces a JavaScript component called thePortlet Hub that manages the state of all portlets on a portal page.<p>Some terminology:<dl><dt>Portlet Hub</dt><dd>JavaScript component that manages the state of all portlets on a portalpage.It is considered to be part of the portal implementation.This document describes its JavaScript interfaces and behavior.<p>Portlet JavaScript code can use the Portlet Hub programming interface to modifyits state by setting private and public render parameters to submit forms whileremaining in the Ajax application paradigm.<p>Many portlets can be present on the page and the portlets are in general independentof one another and they are not aware of the state of other portlets,so they are unable to generate URLs properly representingthe complete page state.The Portlet Hub provides methods that allow portlets to obtain URLsrepresenting the current portal page state.<p>The programming interface and behavior of this component is standardized by JSR 362.</dd><dt>Portlet Client</dt><dd>JavaScript code written by the portlet developer that uses the portlet hubto manage its state and to obtain URLs for retrieving data.</dd></dl><h5>Changing the Portlet State</h5><p>The portlet client can use portlet hub functions to initiate state changes.<p>The portlet client can set publicand private render parameters as well as the portlet mode and window state.<p>In addition, the portlet client can submit aportlet action request that uses HTTP POST semantics.The portal will execute the portlet Action Phase and Event Phase processing onthe server and return the updated page state to the portlet hub.<p>After the requested state change has been performed, the portlet hub will usuallyprovide each affected portlet client with its updated state information.<p>However, regardless of whether the state change was initiated by settingparameters or through a portlet action, the portal may respond by completelyrefreshing the page.The portal may do so in order to support portlets that are affected by the statechange but do not participate in the portlet client-side support, or forimplementation-specific reasons.<p>If the portal responds to a state change request by refreshing the page, theportlets will not be updated with new page state information before thepage refresh is carried out.<h5>Receiving Portlet State Updates</h5><p>When a state change occurs that affects a portlet, the portlet hub informs theaffected portlet client of its new state through use of acallback function.The change causing the update does not necessarily need to be initiated by theportlet client itself.<p>For example, when portlet A changes apublic render parameter used by portlet B, the portlethub will inform both the portlet A and the portlet B clients of that change.<h5>Portlet Client Events</h5><p>Portlet client events consist of an event type and an event payload. Both are defined byby the portlet clients themselves.<p>Portlet client events have no connection to the server-side portlet event mechanism.<p>The portlet hub provides utility functions that enable the portlet clientto dispatch and listen for portlet client events.<h5>Error Handling</h5><p>When the portlet hub can recognize an error during function execution, the error willbe reported to the portlet client through an exception.<p>However, some methods initiate work that is performed asynchronously.Errors that occur during asynchronous processing will be reported to the porteltclient through the <a href="global.html#onError">onError</a> callback function.<h5>Important Considerations</h5><p>The portlet hub calls the portlet client callback functions in several situations as describedabove.When the portlet hub calls the portlet client, the portlet client may navigateto a different page or may initiate another change to the portlet statethat could potentially cause a page refresh.<p>Due to this behavior, the delivery of neither portlet state updates norportlet client events can be guaranteed.<p>The portlet hub provides for orderly state transitions by allowing only asingle blocking operation (action, setPortletState,startPartialAction) to be active at any one time.<p>The state transition is considered to be active from the initial portletclient call to one of the blocking operations until the portlethub has performed the requested state change and has informed all ofthe affected portlet clients by firing the corresponding onStateChangeevents.<p>This has the following implications:<ol><li>It is not possible to initiate a sequence of blocking operations.<p>For example, once a portlet client calls the {@link setPortletState} method,it cannot call any additional blocking method until after itsonStateChange listener function has been called.</li><li>It is not possible to initiate a blocking operation duringexecution of the onStateChange listener function, since execution ofthat function belongs to the preceeding state change operation.</li></ol><hr></div>
