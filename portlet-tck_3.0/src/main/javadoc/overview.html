    <p>
    This document describes the JSR 362 Portlet Specification 3.0 Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).
    The TCK helps portal vendors test compatibility with the Portlet Specification by providing 
    test cases that prove compliance with the specification.
    </p>
    <p>
    The TCK implements the assertions contained in the 
    <a href="doc-files/JSR362Assertions.pdf" target="_blank">JSR 362 TCK Assertions</a> document.           
    </p>
    <p>
    The README.txt file contained in the project base directory explains how the TCK can be used.
